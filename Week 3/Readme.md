for information about the app, type -

By default, your app is deployed on a free dyno. 
Free dynos will sleep after a half hour of inactivity (if they donâ€™t receive any traffic). 
This causes a delay of a few seconds for the first request upon waking. 
Subsequent requests will perform normally. 
Free dynos also consume from a monthly, account-level quota of free dyno hours - as long as the quota is not exhausted, all free apps can continue to run.
